This is the student created BoyneChat. This is a messaging system, intended to be ran on Microbits. This is intended to only be used with two devices. More than two have not been tested, and may create issues/instabilities.

Usage : To connect the two devices, turn both on. They should display a square. Wait until that square becomes filled. This is to check for interference. Press the microbit logo on one device. You should quickly see a checkmark appear on both devices. Then, once the chat logo appears on both devices, you may begin chatting. Use the A button to select what letter you'd like to send, then click the B button to send. The message will be displayed on the other device.

Common Issues : If you keep seeing the . . . being displayed on the device trying to connect, even if the other device shows a square, it means that the devices could not connect.

If you see an X while waiting for the square to become filled, it means it has detected interference.
